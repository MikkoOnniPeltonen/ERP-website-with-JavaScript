WEBSITE FOR HANDLING LISTS OF PRODUCTS

The idea behind this website application is to create an interface
 with drag and drop API for handling lists of products that would go into production. 
The implementation would be operating with data in the manufacturing business. 

Project Description:
The application receives the lists of products sold to customers.
These lists are used to make the lists for the different production lines
in the manufacturing plant by drag and drop operation. This way of operating is easy to handle. 
On the left side of the page are the different lines of production to be chosen. 
Only the lists of one production line is seen at any one time. 
The rest of the page is seen in three sections which are three separate lists. 
The most left one would be the list of the sales that have been done for the chosen production line. 
The middle one would be the list to be made for production. The most right one would be the list of products in production already. 
On top of these lists there would be buttons to use for the making of the list. Edit, Save and Send. 
By clicking edit, you are able to drag products from the first list from the left to the middle list and drop products there. 
By clicking save, you are able to save the list that was made in the middle. 
By clicking send, you are able to send the new list into the most right one, meaning they would go into production.

Phase One:
The outlook of the page has been made. The buttons are missing functionality. 
I have made some drag and drop functionality into the list divs themselves. I have created an sql file for the database to have orders in it.
The connectivity with the database and the website made with javascript is not worked out yet.

Phase Two:
Revise the code to be more readable. To make the list items show on the website as wanted and making some example ones into the sql database. 
To show lists of each production line separately. To apply drag and drop for them. The button functionalities to be put in place. 

Phase Three:
Make the search and archives work such way that list items can be searched from the archives. 
Archives holds the old lists gone through production. Implement a way to make list items to disappear
after when they have been produced and move into the archives. Archives as a button
